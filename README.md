Overview
--------

**Scientific Computing Project (SCP): Image Classification Pipeline**

This project provides a **modular, extensible, and research-oriented deep learning pipeline** for image classification, developed as part of the Scientific Computing Project (SCP). It is designed for experimentation, hyperparameter optimization, and architecture extensibility.

The first implemented architecture is based on <a href="https://github.com/hounaar/SCP/tree/master/VGG-16">**VGG-16**</a>, with clear separation of training, tuning, and evaluation components. Additional architectures will be added in future updates.
